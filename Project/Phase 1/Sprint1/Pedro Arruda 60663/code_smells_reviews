This was a good find since a whole class without function is a lot of unnecessary code! Good job.

No Comments -> Review by Ana Gadelha 59943 - 21/10/2022

This code is well identified, the class is still big (142 lines of code),
and with no comments it will take a lot more time to understand its functionality.
